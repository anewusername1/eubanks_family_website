<h4>Grid System</h4>
<p>JPolite 2 makes use of <a href="http://bluetrip.org/">BlueTrip CSS framework</a>'s grid system,
that the layout of the columns can be best set as grid classes, e.g., 'span-6', 'span-12 last' ...
In that way you can easily and elegantly arrange the layout of columns
</p>

<p>The width of the container is 950px by default, and you can change that by changing <b>#content</b>
element in <b>style.css</b></p>

<p>Further setting details can be found under "<a href="#" class="tab" rel="t2">Layout</a>" tab.</p>

<h4>Feature Under Development</h4>
<p class="notice">Modules within a column can also have grid layout styles applied, but that'll require
some intelligence built into the columns. Currently this feature is not of top priority, but I'll re-consider
according to requests.</p>

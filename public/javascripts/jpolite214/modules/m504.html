<p>Page background under a certain tab can be customized in <b>_columnLayout</b> variable in <b>modules.js</b>, e.g.,</p>
<pre>
	...
	_default: { bg:'normal',
	...
	},
	t2:{ bg:'darker',
	...
	},
	...
</pre>
<p>The value '<b>normal</b>' and '<b>darker</b>' refers to two class names defined in <b>styles.css</b>. That is,
you customize page background through the use of CSS classes, which can use both colors and images</p>

<h4>Known Issues</h4>
<p class="notice">Currently JPolite2 makes use of jQuery UI's <b>switchClass</b> function to make a smooth transition
between different background settings. But this feature does not work under WebKit based browsers, i.e., Google Chrome
& Apple Safari. Even worse, the background stay unchanged between tabs.
</p>

<p>So far there seems no sound solution yet that you need to make a decision here:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Forget about transition, use plain attr("class", "new_class_name") to achieve maximum compatibility.</li>
	<li>Forget about WebKit, make switchClass a special treat for non-WebKit browsers.</li>	
</ol>
